History
-------

This is an old school project written in 2001 for Delphi/Pascal
environment.  As a 20 year anniversary, in 2021, the project was
converted to be compatible with the Lazarus environment so that it can
be ran on multiple platforms.  The new version has been tested to work
on Linux at least.
